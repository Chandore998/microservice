# Node.js Microservice with RabbitMQ and Kafka

This repository contains a microservice built using Node.js that leverages RabbitMQ and Kafka for messaging and event streaming. The microservice architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance, making it suitable for modern distributed systems.

## Features

- **Node.js**: Utilizes the power and flexibility of Node.js for building scalable network applications.
- **RabbitMQ**: Implements RabbitMQ for message brokering, ensuring reliable and asynchronous communication between different parts of the system.
- **Kafka**: Uses Kafka for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable event streaming, ideal for processing real-time data streams.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Designed as a microservice, promoting separation of concerns and facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

## Components

- **Producer Service**: Sends messages to RabbitMQ or Kafka topics, acting as the entry point for incoming data.
- **Consumer Service**: Listens to RabbitMQ queues or Kafka topics, processing messages as they arrive.
- **Message Broker Configuration**: Configuration files and scripts for setting up RabbitMQ and Kafka brokers, including connection settings, topics, queues, and exchange configurations.
- **Error Handling and Retries**: Robust error handling mechanisms to manage message failures and retries.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging and monitoring to track message flow and system performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- RabbitMQ (version x.x.x)
- Kafka (version x.x.x)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1. Configure RabbitMQ and Kafka:
    - Update `config/rabbitmq-config.json` with your RabbitMQ settings.
    - Update `config/kafka-config.json` with your Kafka settings.

2. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add the necessary environment variables as specified in the `.env.example` file.

### Running the Service

1. Start the microservice:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Producer**: To send messages, make HTTP requests to the producer endpoints (e.g., `/api/send-message`).
- **Consumer**: The consumer will automatically process messages from the configured RabbitMQ queues or Kafka topics.
