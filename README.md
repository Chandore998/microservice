## Features

- **Node.js**: Utilizes the power and flexibility of Node.js for building scalable network applications.
- **RabbitMQ**: Implements RabbitMQ for message brokering, ensuring reliable and asynchronous communication between different parts of the system.
- **Kafka**: Uses Kafka for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable event streaming, ideal for processing real-time data streams.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Designed as a microservice, promoting separation of concerns and facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

## Components

- **Producer Service**: Sends messages to RabbitMQ or Kafka topics, acting as the entry point for incoming data.
- **Consumer Service**: Listens to RabbitMQ queues or Kafka topics, processing messages as they arrive.
- **Message Broker Configuration**: Configuration files and scripts for setting up RabbitMQ and Kafka brokers, including connection settings, topics, queues, and exchange configurations.
- **Error Handling and Retries**: Robust error handling mechanisms to manage message failures and retries.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging and monitoring to track message flow and system performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- RabbitMQ (version x.x.x)
- Erlang (version x.x.x)
- RabbitMQ Server (version x.x.x)
- Kafka (version x.x.x)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chandore998/microservice.git
    cd microservice
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Service

1. Start the microservice:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Producer**: To send messages, make HTTP requests to the producer endpoints (e.g., `/api/send-message`).
- **Consumer**: The consumer will automatically process messages from the configured RabbitMQ queues or Kafka topics.
